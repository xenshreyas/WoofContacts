# WoofContacts

### WoofContacts is a sophisticated Full Stack Contact Book Web-Application. This application is designed to provide users with a seamless and efficient way to manage their contact information online. The core programming language that powers the entire application is Python, harnessing the power of Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python for creating Web Applications. Flask handles routing, request processing and content rendering, allowing for a responsive website that can be accessed across various plaforms.

### For the Back end, WoofContacts uses a robust SQL database to securely store user data, including contact information and associated metadata. Additionally, as security is paramount, WoofContacts employs the Werkzeug library to encrypt user passwords to guarantee confidentiality and protection of sensitive user information.
